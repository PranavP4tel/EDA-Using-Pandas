4. Assessing toss decision taken by teams when they won the match
5. Wins of teams in different stadiums

B. Performed EDA on another dataset - Ultra Marathons: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633

Tasks performed:
1. Filtering races with 50km and 50mi distance, held in 2020 and in USA
2. Cleaning event name and athlete performance columns, and creating Athlete age column
3. Dropping unused columns
4. Finding null values and duplicate values and dropping the same

Assessed:

2. Average speed for atheletes as per age, for 50mi marathon length
3. Marathons held in different seasons
4. Average speed for athletes for different seasons
5. Age groups with best performances in 50mi marathon

Creating plots for:

2. Distribution of average speed of athletes for 50mi
3. Distribution of average speed for different marathons as per gender
4. Distribution of average speed and age, categorized by gender

C. Performed EDA on the World population dataset.
Worked on:
1. Understanding correlation between data and visualizing it
2. Assessing population for continents over time, plotting the same
3. Assessing population density (per sq.km) of top 10 countries as per 2022 and visualizing the same
4. Visualizing the World population percentage contribution of different continents
